                    <p>Our primary tool for custom application development is Laravel. We like the complexity and simplicity of Laravel. We have used it from Laravel 5 since 2015.</p>

                    <p>We understand Laravel and aim to understand it better; hence, we try to <a href="https://github.com/laravel/framework/commits?author=iamgergo">contribute directly to the main repository</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Here are a few examples of the applications that we made:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>We created a web app for the biggest competition in Hungary, which had seven weekly rounds and up to 2000 players.</li>
                        <li>We made an inventory application for art galleries with portfolio showcase options, embeddable galleries to 3rd-party pages, and various PDF exports.</li>
                        <li>We shipped a custom motion handling application for a non-profit organization.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://shop.conedevelopment.com/">We built our own webshop</a>, that manages licenses to our premium WordPress and Composer packages. The shop is based on Laravel, Root, Bazar and Spruce CSS – our open source packages – integrated with Stripe and Billingo.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>We have a routine with the following Laravel - related - tools:</strong></p>

                    <ul style="column-count: 2;">
                        <li>

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We always try to follow Laravel's best practices and coding standards but can adapt to any predefined style guide.</p>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>We develop both custom themes and plugins. We aim for the least amount of dependency in both cases.</p>

                    <p>In theme development, we don't use a builder; <strong>we operate with ACF fields</strong> and, when needed, create a simple builder with flexible fields. Our method's biggest advantage for us and the clients is that the result is easy to maintain and update while it is fast.</p>

                    <p>We use a small subset of plugins (besides ACF): Contact Form 7 for form handling, WP Rocket for more performance optimization, and some other smaller utilities.</p>

                    <p><strong>We created and/or maintain many custom WordPress plugins:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Our most popular one is a custom payment integration for <a href="https://simplepay.conedevelopment.com/">WooCommerce with SimplePay</a>.</li>
                        <li>A payment gateway integration for <a href="https://barion.conedevelopment.com/">WooCommerce with Barion</a>.</li>
                        <li>A DHL shipping method integration.</li>
                        <li>Custom and dynamic product creation extension for Woo.</li>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>We like to keep the project management lean and clean. We always use version management, preferably GitHub, but we have experience with any major solutions.</p>

                    <p>We often use GitHub issues (or projects in case of the more complex ones) for project-related communications but can adapt to any preferred method.</p>

                    <p>We are the biggest fan of two-way communication based on mutual respect.</p>
