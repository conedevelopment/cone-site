                    <p><strong>Adam is responsible for the design and the front-end</strong>, while <strong>Gergő takes care of the back-end and some front-end tasks as well</strong>. This way, we can extend each other’s skills, and we are able to ship well-crafted code. Currently, we are located in Switzerland and Hungary. We like to communicate in English.</p>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>On the front-end we do UI design, including working with CSS frameworks and writing custom CSS code for the needs that a framework cannot fill. Also, we work with several <strong>JavaScript technologies</strong> and frameworks – for example <strong>Vue.js</strong>, <strong>GreenSock</strong> – but we believe, frameworks can’t solve everything, so often we write more or less complex JavaScript codes as well.</p>
                    <p>Combining with Laravel, <strong>we can build comprehensive solutions with Vue.js</strong>. We know it well and like it much. </p>
                    <p>To cover the back-end <strong>we develop themes and plugins for WordPress </strong>sites, but if we face with a bit larger scale, our choice is the <strong>Laravel ecosystem</strong>. </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>We may help you in any Laravel based project because:</strong>
