                    <p><strong>Adam is responsible for the UI design and the front-end</strong>, while <strong>Gergő takes care of the back-end and some front-end tasks as well</strong>. This way, we can extend each other’s skills, and we are able to ship well-crafted code. Currently, we are located in Hungary (EU). We like to communicate in English.</p>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>We work with CSS frameworks on the front-end, including our Spruce CSS. We have experience with several <strong>JavaScript technologies</strong> and frameworks – for example, <strong>Vue.js</strong>, <strong>Alpine.js</strong>, <strong>GSAP</strong> – but we also highly prefer vanilla JS where possible.</p>
                    <p>Combining Laravel with Vue.js, <strong>we can build comprehensive solutions</strong>. We know them well and like them much. </p>
                    <p>On the back-end side <strong>we develop themes and plugins for WordPress</strong>, but if we face with a bit larger scale, our choice is the <strong>Laravel ecosystem</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>We may help you with any Laravel-based project because:</strong></p>

                            <a href="https://github.com/laravel/framework/commits?author=iamgergo">Many of our PRs</a> were merged into the Laravel Core and also in other first-party repos as well.
                        </li>
                        <li>We have an <a href="https://exam.laravelcert.com/is/D-Nagy-Gergo/certified-since/2020-06-23">official Laravel certification</a> which was taken by Gergő. </li>
                        <li>We wrote <a href="https://pineco.de/category/laravel/">many articles</a> about Laravel that helped many developers solve their problems.</li>

                            <a href="https://packagist.org/users/conedevelopment/packages/">Our Laravel packages</a> were downloaded more than 100.000 times until today.

                    <p>We like static sites. Our first choice for them is <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>, which is a simplistic JS-based solution.</p>
